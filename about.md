## Instructions for use of the Type 2 diabetes risk predictor


This web app is based on the AUSDRISK scoring system to predict the risk of type 2 diabetes.
The AUSDRISK system calculates the risk of developing diabetes from the medical history and lifestyle factors.

#### Results from the web app

After you have submitted your data, a plot showing your predicted Type 2 diabetes risk group will be made.
The prediction is made on the basis of fixed traits such as your age, gender, ethnicity, and medical history, 
and on variable traits such as your smoking, eating and exercise habits.  
You will be able to see whether your risk score falls into the Low, Medium, or High risk groups.


Furthermore, if you have any variable traits that negatively affect your diabetes risk, 
you will see your baseline risk indicated in the plot as well.
The baseline risk gives you an indication of how much you can decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

Head over to the second panel in the navigation bar to try it out!
